# Spotify Song Recommendation System based on Artists

# Background
I want to create a spotify playlist auto creator that would be able to take different artists based on your own music listening data while at the same time also adding a certain percentage of songs that you  like based on a recommendation system. Also if there would be a way to put a limit on the # of songs in a single playlist. Example, English Hip-Hop & Indian Music playlist  with 100 songs(including new recs).  Bc as of rn, everyone has to manually add music or create an auto playlist thats only similar to a specific datapoint such as (song name, artist, genre, album, etc) so if there way a way to make it seamless and easier to make a collection of the top say 50 hits for 2 genre/language(s) or more, I think it would be helpful to a lot.

# Modeling

# The Recommendations

# Conclusion

# Limitations
 - Because the final dataset I modeled on was only about 12000 songs which is a severe lack of representation from Spotify's 70 million song database.
  
# Future Work
- Maybe add genres to dataset along with the other current audio features to see if recommendations improve.
