# SpotifyGenrePlaylist
I want to create a spotify playlist auto creator that would be able to take different types genres and/or languages based on your own music listening data while at the same time also adding a certain percentage of songs that you  like based on a recommendation system. Also if there would be a way to put a limit on the # of songs in a single playlist. Example, English Hip-Hop & Indian Music playlist  with 100 songs(including new recs).  Bc as of rn, everyone has to manually add music or create an auto playlist thats only similar to a specific datapoint such as (song name, artist, genre, album, etc) so if there way a way to make it seamless and easier to make a collection of the top say 50 hits for 2 genre/language(s) or more, I think it would be helpful to a lot.
